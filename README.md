# Interpol (Interpolation of Polynomials)

I made this repository as a "playground" for testing various programming languag
es that i used, want to use, and are interested in.  I will try my best to adher
e to each conventional programming language syntax to prevent code replication b
etween languages, while providing a somewhat similar function for each different
programming languages. I've also provided some test cases available in the folde
r [Test](Test/).

I've only tested these code in my local machine running Arch Linux. The input fi
le must be on the following format

```text
n
x1 y1
x2 y2
x3 y3
...
xn yn
xn+1 yn+1
```

Where `n` denotes the highest degree and the pair `(xi, yi)` denotes the point p
assed by the function. The input must have at minimum `n + 1` number of points.

Requirements and setup for each languages are available in the corresponding dir
ectories.
